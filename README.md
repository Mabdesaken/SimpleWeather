# SimpleWeather
An app that shows the weather in Aarhus city, and is WIP

I've been making this app, to freshen up my skills with fragments and importing open API's such as openweatherAPI's
information, where i receive a json file, and then i have to parse that, in order for the Java to understand it. So it is a bit of an exercise 
in both fragments and json.

I'm also trying out a little work with the action bar, and a little bit of manipulation with relative layouts.
